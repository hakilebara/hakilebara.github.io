    <h2 class="page__title">Monappliphoto</h2>
    
      <p>Monappliphoto.com is a SaaS (Software as a Service) business I founded in 2015. It allows profesionnal photographers to create
      customs mobile apps for each of their clients. After a shooting a photographer uploads his/her photos to Monappliphoto and chooses from a
      list of available themes. Monappliphoto then automatically generates a mobile app of the photos and the photographer sends the app
      to his/her clients. <br> Mobile apps have two advantages over responsive photo galleries: they provides a greater user experience and they
      are a powerful marketing tool for the photographer (custom homescreen icon, push notifications, ..).<br>
      Our vision is to help photographers book more sales by helping them give a greater user experience to their clients.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Monappliphoto is in beta test and will start accepting customers later this year. In 2017 we are focusing on the French market.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Monappliphoto's front-end is a large Ember.js app. Building it from scratch has given me extensive experience with Ember.js.</p>
   
    <h2 class="page__title">Before Monappliphoto</h2>
    
      <p>
        Before starting Monappliphoto I worked for 5 year as a site reliability engineer in Shanghai and Singapore.
        I worked for fast growing e-commerce startups and a Fortune 500 financial service company.
        I taught myself programming, UX and web design.
