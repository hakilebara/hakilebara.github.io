For reasons I donâ€™t understand my posts on Twitter are no longer visible to the public. They are visible here though: [https://xcancel.com/hakilebara](https://xcancel.com/hakilebara).


I have little hope that this will get fixed. This is as good an opportunity as any to leave this site.
I intend to do most of my writing on this website starting from now.


No more arbitrary limitation on character count. No more ads. No more engagement bait. No more blatant disregard for content moderation.
