    <h1 class="page__title">about me</h1>
    <p>I'm Frédéric Soumaré (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hakilebara">@hakilebara</a>), a freelance software developer and web designer from France. I love the Web and I have a burning passion for the Theatre.</p>
        <p>I have lived and worked in Shanghai and Singapore. I live now in Paris.</p>
        <p> Feel free to check out <a href="/work">my work</a> to learn more about what I do.</p>

    <h2 class="page__subtitle">Technical Background</h2>

    <p>I started programming for the web back in 2007 developping XULRunner applications.        However my background and formal education are in system and network engineering.
       I have worked for 5 years as a site reliability engineer for fast growing e-commerce startups and a Fortune 500 financial service company. My day to day job was to configure, deploy, maintain, troubleshoot and automate large and critical infrastructures of Linux/Solaris Cisco/Juniper (L2 MPLS, BGP, ISIS) boxes in the Asia Pacific Region.</p><br>
       <p>In 2015 I decided to learn software development and started building Monappliphoto - a French SaaS business for professional photographers.</p>

    <h3 class="page__subtitle">Front-End</h3>

    
       <p>I have a strong focus on HTML5, CSS, Javascript and responsive design.       To create rich front-end applications my tool of choice is       <a target="_blank" href="https://guides.emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>.       I love this framework for its community, its ecosystem and its dedication to stability.</p>
       <p>I have an eye for design. I love drawing vector illustrations using       <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>       check out my (small but growing) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/fredericsob02f">Behance page</a>.
       I am also comfortable writing CSS animations check out my (very small but growing :) ) <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/hakilebara/">Codepen</a>.</p>
        

    <h3 class="page__subtitle&quot;">Back-End</h3>

    
       <p>I focus on Rails, Node.js and Wordpress/WooCommerce.</p>
       <p>I know how to implement and deploy backend systems that are performant, reliable and supervised (Nagios / CFengine).</p>
       <p>Given my background I am naturally drawn to Erlang and OTP. I am currently teaching myself how to build resilient distributed systems       using Elixir and Phoenix.</p>
  

    <h2 class="page__subtitle">Education</h2>

    
       <p>I graduated in 2009 from the University of Technology of Troyes in Information System Management and Network Engineering.</p>
       <p>I have a postgraduate degrees from the University of Cranfield in operations management.</p>
